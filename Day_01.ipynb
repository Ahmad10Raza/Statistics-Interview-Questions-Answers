    "# A. What is Z-test?\n",
    "\n",
    "A z-test is a statistical test that is used to compare the mean of a sample to the mean of a population. It is a parametric test, which means that it assumes that the data follows a normal distribution. The z-test is most commonly used when the sample size is large (greater than 30) and the population variance is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "The z-test statistic is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "z = (sample mean - population mean) / (standard deviation / sqrt(sample size))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* z is the z-test statistic\n",
    "* sample mean is the mean of the sample data\n",
    "* population mean is the mean of the population\n",
    "* standard deviation is the standard deviation of the population\n",
    "* sqrt(sample size) is the square root of the sample size\n",
    "\n",
    "The z-test statistic is then compared to a critical value to determine whether the null hypothesis should be rejected. The critical value is the value of z that has a probability of 0.50 (or 50%) in the tail of the normal distribution. For example, if the significance level is 0.05, then the critical value would be 1.96. This means that there is a 5% chance of obtaining a z-value greater than 1.96 if the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the z-test statistic is greater than the critical value, then the null hypothesis is rejected. This means that there is enough evidence to conclude that the mean of the sample is different from the mean of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a z-test:\n",
    "\n",
    "A teacher claims that the mean score of students in his class is greater than 82. The standard deviation of the scores is 20, and a sample of 81 students was selected. The mean score of the sample is 90.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test the teacher's claim, we can use a z-test. The z-test statistic is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "z = (90 - 82) / (20 / sqrt(81)) = 2.23\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical value for a two-tailed z-test with a significance level of 0.05 is 1.96. Since the z-test statistic is greater than the critical value, we can reject the null hypothesis. This means that there is enough evidence to conclude that the mean score of the students in the teacher's class is greater than 82.\n",

    "- x represents the individual data point\n",
    "- μ represents the mean of the distribution\n",
    "- σ represents the standard deviation of the distribution\n",

    "A positive z-score indicates that the data point is above the mean, while a negative z-score indicates that the data point is below the mean. The magnitude of the z-score indicates how far the data point deviates from the mean in terms of standard deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we have a dataset with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. If we want to calculate the z-score for a data point of 65, we can use the formula:\n",

    "conversion rates, click-through rates, or other key performance indicators (KPIs).\n",

    "1. Data-Driven Decision Making: A/B testing allows companies to make data-driven decisions\n",

    "Here are a few approaches to address the issue of multiple comparisons:\n",
    "1. Bonferroni Correction: The Bonferroni correction is a widely used method to adjust the\n",

The t-statistic measures the difference in means between the control and experimental groups, while the p-value tells us the probability of obtaining a t-statistic as extreme as the observed one, assuming the null hypothesis is true (i.e., there is no difference between the means of the two groups).\n",
